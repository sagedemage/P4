					Apple decided to ship their computers with an ARM CPU called the M1 chip.
					I found this interesting is because Apple is one of the few companies pushing hard for ARM adoption.
					Most of the CPU market share is dominated by x86 CPU from two major companies, Intel and AMD.
				</p>
				<h3 id="mac"> Why M1 Mac? </h3>
				<p> Many users praised the performance and efficiency of the M1 Mac.
					This surprised me because Apple has been known for charging overpriced computers and there were computers that offer a much better price.
					The M1 Mac has better battery efficiency compared to all x86 computers in the market currently.
					There were benchmarks proving that M1 Mac computer's GPU is the best in the market.
				</p>
				<h3 id="problems"> The Problems </h3>
				<p>
					However the M1 Mac is not worth it for gaming because it lacks software support since the hardware is new.
					It is highly unlikely for M1 Mac devices to have great support for gaming since it has a small market share.
					Windows has the highest desktop market share and gaming is better supported.
					The price is way too high for most people to afford it. I do not see the M1 Mac actually gaining a massive market share.
				</p>
				<h3 id="closing"> Closing </h3>
				<p>
					Apple is finally doing something to make their products appealing.
					I will admit that if I had the money, I can replace Windows for programming.
					As a Linux user, a UNIX operating system is great for doing programming and the terminal is great for running
					CLI programs like docker and managing your programming and text files.
					Programmers and designers will probably like it if they are willing to buy it for the premium experience.
